Welcome! I am Hendrik Mayer, a second-year PhD student working in the [GEMS Lab](https://gemslab.github.io/) led by Danai Koutra, focusing on representation learning and graph neural networks.

Before that, I obtained my MEng in Computer Science (2024) and BS in Computer Science and Physics (2023) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
